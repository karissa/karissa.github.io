I went to a workshop on inclusive problem definition and building bridges with community members and now I am feeling inspired. I have been given some anti-racist advice by a few different people of color multiple times and feel it may be useful for some if I repeat my interpretation for my white friends here.

If you're white and you're being called out for being a racist, own it. We are all racist. We've been brought up in a thick soup of racism. It's not an attack on you as a person, as long as you're willing to own the fact that you fucked up and you're gonna keep on working on it. This is the reality that we are wrestling with every day. All of us who have been raised to be racist are going to fall down, trip up, but the key is pulling yourself back up and continuing on your anti-racist project -- yourself. We are all in this together and being called out is simply your humbling reminder of all the work we have left to do. We aren't going to undo 500 years of systematic racism and genocide in just a few generations. It's going to take a lot of work. Let's do it, though. I'm not giving up. Lots of love.
