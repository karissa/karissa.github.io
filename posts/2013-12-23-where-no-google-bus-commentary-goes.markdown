With income inequality and bad transit, we can't live together. Some of us are having a tough time living at all.

In a recent article on Pueblo Lands, the author spends some time outlining the
lesser known cities of Richmond and San Pablo. Amid all of the hubbub about the
Google bus protests in [San
Francisco](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-techbus-protest-sanfrancisco-idUSBRE9BJ1BC20131220)
and
[Oakland](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231758/protesters-target-silicon-valley-shuttles-smash-google-bus-window)
(which were varied tactically by region, interesting for a sociologist), this
piece  <!-- more --> sheds light on the income disparities that people aren't talking about. The author
particularly focuses on how these communities have gotten worse since the
financial crisis. You can read the article

One thing missing from this piece is anything close to a call to action, a
plan, or even a summation of ideas to head there. All I got was a hopelessly small paragraph at the end
that identifies one part of the cause:

The truth is, there is vast, destabilizing income inequality and separation by
race and class in most big American cities (even my alma mater Bloomington, IN,
[which ranked
\#1](http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/bloomington-unequal-city-based-census-data-23634/)
just ahead of Atlanta).

The only reason people are focusing on it in the Bay is because tech industry is
booming and the public transit is bad, creating a magnifying glass for it (NY
had this problem before SF).  By subsidizing corporations, the government
incentivizes them to stay in the region, get taxed, and employ people. But when
does it stop? When do we decide that these tax breaks are actually doing more
harm than good by incentivizing the industry to stay in the area?

The traffic here is insane. Public transportation is aging, inadequate, and
expensive. The Bay Area is packed full of people, and they all need a car to
get around (except SF/East Bay).

I won't be the first or the last to say it -- Silicon Valley sucks as a place
to live, work, and play. Forget driving in Silicon Valley 7am-10am and 4-7:30pm.
Expect to drive at 5mph.  [The traffic is literally killing all of
you.](http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2011/05/your_commute_is_killing_you.html)
Silicon Valley could really use better public transportation and more mixed
income neighborhoods.

Importantly, how does the economy expect low income workers to work in a place
they cannot afford to live? What happens when the gas prices go up too far?  Or they can't
afford to maintain their cars? Their paycheck is gone. [And approximately 38%
of the population is living paycheck to
paycheck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States). It's
a dysfunctional infrastructure, just waiting to collapse under a lack of structural integrity.

What do you think we should do?  Should we be turning our attention toward the google busses or
the corporate bosses or the politicians or ourselves? What should we demand?

The Google bus protests did their job by bringing attention to this matter, and
now we are having a public conversation.  Let's find eachother and move forward
with some short and long-term proposals.  I'm interested in
hearing what you have to say.
