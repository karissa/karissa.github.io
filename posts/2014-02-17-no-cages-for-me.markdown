"A fat bird in a cage should be happy, people say. But when the cage door opens, it will realize what's been missing." - a friend

At the end of last year, I got a job offer from Google as a software engineer. I took it. Google is the dream job that everyone wants, right? My friends told me if I was unhappy at my last job, I just need to go. Build my resume.

So I did. I went. I quit my job in Austin and flew to San Francisco, CA. I started to settle in, but also began to remember that summer of 2011. I finally realized: I had walked directly into the thing that I avoided when I turned down the offers from Microsoft and Amazon. Two days before I started my job, I got an email from my recruiter and a subsequent phone call from a Google internal lawyer that said I would violate the code of conduct if I continued working on a side project I very much cared about called Papertalk. This side project is a non-profit open-source website for discussing scientific articles and topics. This project is something I've been passionate about, excited about, and obsessing over for over 4 months -- it gives back to the community in some of the only ways that I can, through code and communication. For Google to tell me I couldn't work on it actually isn't that surprising in retrospect, but I didn't realize how hard it would hit me. How much I cared about it and what it means to "give back" to the community. There is a hole here, in my heart, and it's getting bigger the longer I stay.

I'm more of a dreamer than a hacker, and I need to embrace this part of my life. I am starting a job as software engineer and product evangelist at Datapad.io; pursuing my passion for open scientific discussions with Papertalk.org; and becoming a contributing editor to a new blog for tech professionals.

My new job at Datapad will be a good experience for me to grow skills I want to master:

* public speaking and writing;
* product demonstration and teaching;
* technical and non-technical recruitment;
* company/project growth;
* ...and continuing to stay fresh by contributing directly to the product.


This desire to "give back" to the community extends far beyond just Papertalk.
My desire to continue grad school at some point still stays with me every day,
and I believe the above skills will help me in that endeavor as well. I did not
expect much from Google except a steady paycheck, some software engineering
maintenance experience, and some insider information that I am not allowed to
talk about. What I didn't realize is how much it'd make me feel sad, trapped,
and alone. I'd rather take a risk on a small group that plans to really improve
technology in a much-needed area than increase shareholder value at an already
bustling company, feeling like a cog in the machine. Google will be fine
without me. One day I may see myself at a big company like Google in R&D, but
that is a while away.

I will no longer work for a large entity that doesn't respect my autonomy.
