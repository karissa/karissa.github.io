This was a whirlwind response. I knew this was going to be big, but I didn't
really expect this kind of attention and virality. There are some glaring
mistakes in some of the reporting, as well as plenty of exagerations. This
experience gives me more caution when submitting things to press releases, and
to be careful about what you publish to make sure it is 100% correct.

A few months ago, we tried to submit this paper to Science and Nature before
PlosOne, but received desk rejections. I wonder if they'd want it now?
