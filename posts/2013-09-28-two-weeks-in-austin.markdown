I've been in Austin, TX for two weeks now. I've learned a lot about myself, and
others, and the south, and Austin, and software development, and relationships,
and collaboration, and open tools since I've been here. If you want to know
more about the nitty gritty personal stuff, we're just going to have to catch
up offline (or online, but not on a blog). Regardless of that, I'm going to
outline some things I've noticed since I've been here. 


1. *Austin is sweaty.* _and no one cares_ This is the funnest part of being in
   a place that is pretty hot almost all year - you can dance your ass off and
sweat up a storm, and no one is going to look twice. You can ride your bike
<!-- more-->
five miles, play in a recreational softball game, and go to the local gay bar
without even breaking a sweat (emotionally or mentally ((also, that actually
happened)). The coolest part is that because it's so freakin hot, I've gotten
used to 79 degrees for a standard indoor AC situation. In Indiana, 74 was often
pushing it on the comfortable side.. but maybe that has something to do with
the humidity. It's very amazing how quickly one's body adapts to new temperates.

2. *It's a great place to be a kid* _the kind of kid who can drink legally_ I
   literally walked downtown last night meaning to go to a chill cheap beer bar and
pizza truck and passed a nearly naked dude with a fanny pack and a live band
playing dance music with trumpets in an art studio with no cover and free beer.
I still went to that pizza truck, which they say is the best in Texas (after
sweating at the dance party). I approve.  To fully chronicle my fun these 
past two weeks, I'd literally need to spend another thirty minutes on this keyboard 
so I'll just sum it up with the fact that everything they say is true and then some. 

3. *Austin is weird, but don't tell that to the locals* _they're tired of
   hearing it_ The locals here are fantastic and I'm actually good friends with
a few already. But something genuinely common to all of them is that "Keep
Austin Weird" phrase is super touristy, old, and boring, and don't bother
saying it if you want to impress someone. Also, they won't ever tell you this rudely,
because they're too goddamn nice (and I love it).

4. *Southern charm makes way for Austin cool* _mix charm and liberalism and
   you've got a winner_ The harshest criticisims layed out for the south just
don't seem to pan out here in Austin. The people here are fun, hip, and 
20- or 30-something, self-identified Democrat, and single. Compared to the rest
of Texas, which can't seem to get it's head around the gays or anyone else who
seems a bit different, Austin provides a sort of haven and recluse for those of
us who may identify differently than the mainstream. That having been said,
this place lacks racial diversity. Those who seem to be moving here are
increasingly white, and everyone knows it. 

5. *Sex is a big deal* _the kind of deal where everyone fights about it_
   The political landscape is mired with the fallen heroes of the battleground
of sex. Sex education, abortion, sexual orientation, gender identity, sexism --
the Democrats in Austin are fighting. They are fighting an uphill battle in a
state that isn't so friendly to the liberal tenants of sex positive behavior
and gender equality. The first few days I was here, I went to see a variety
show called "Bedpost Confessions." This show played out like an angry and funny
and happy and sad queer feminist revival, complete with slam poetry written to
Rick Perry on abortion and the ownership of women's bodies. Along with the
ongoing discussion and praise of the tennis shoes worn by Wendy Davis during a
12-hour filibuster of an anti-abortion law, and various instances of "endless
gaycation" and "gaylympics" protest/celebrations, the picture of where the line
is drawn between political alignments is quite clear. This was particularly
interesting to me as comign from Bloomington, IN and Santa Rosa, CA,  the focus
is more broad with focuses also on economics, education, and immigration.
Because it's such a big state with large rural swaths, the activists here find
it important to fight and lay the groundwork for those who find themselves
second-class citizens in their hometowns. It's quite empowering, but perhaps a
longer post is necessary to really investigate what I find so intriguing and
important about this political focus.

Continuum is pretty cool, but I can't stop thinking about political, economic,
and social processes. I'll have to go back to get that PhD one day. Until then,
I'm enjoying myself.
