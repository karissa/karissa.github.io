If you're a professor, or teacher, or CTO, or manager, or your company just hired someone, or teaching anyone at all -- **STOP SAYING IT'S EASY!**

As technical people, we have a tendency to say things are "easy." I'm constantly guilty. Thinking about it in my head, the process can seem simple:
<!-- more -->
"Just *ssh* into the *box*"...
"Use numpy 1.7.2, not 1.8"

And my personal favorite that made me feel really dumb when I was a newb,
"Just *put it on your PATH*" (I had no idea what a PATH was, I was flying completely blind).

So how did this habit come about in our community? I thought about it for a
minute and decided it comes from abstractions. We build things in a way that we
can talk about them *abstractly,* that is, in a way that pulls brass and thread
into bells, copper into whistles, and rope into pullies, and together into an
"engine."

The "engine" abstraction is much easier to talk about and understand than all
of its parts. You can get a good picture of what an "engine" might do without
actually knowing what it's made out of.  It frees your mind to think about the
*why* and the *what* -- and you can forget about the *how*. It also lets you
communicate with others much more easily about what's going on or what they can
do to fix their problem.

As people become more comfortable with coding, they start to take abstractions
for granted -- ```export DISTRIBUTE=True in your bash rc``` might start to seem
like English. We speak to eachother literally, in code (the enigma kind, not
the python kind), and there is an entire lexicon surrounding the practice,
enough so that newcomers can become alienated pretty quickly.

This stuff is hard (read: not easy). But sometimes, it's actually helpful for
people to act like things are easy. It relieves stress. I personally like to
think things are a bit easier than they are. It helps me keep it all in my
head, it keeps me motivated, helps me tell myself that it's all going to get finished.

But when we are teaching, we have to switch gears. We can't act like everything
is easy to a newcomer, because it's not\*. That's why they are new.

It makes people think -- "if I can code, why can't I perform these tasks?"

This is probably one of the most alienating feelings I had to overcome as I
started computer science. It was hard to ask questions after people said,
"JUST..." They might as well said "put the manabee on the doohicky." I had no
idea what they just said. But I pretended like I did, and just spent a lot of
time doing searches online... which is fine, but wastes a lot of time and
removes the human element. And some people just quit. We can do better.

I made it. But not everybody does. We wonder why people\*\* don't study
computer science. We need to be more mindful of the fact that we *all* were
there at one point.

So, if you're learning to code, don't worry. If we say "JUST...do that" don't
be alarmed, we aren't trying to alienate you, and we don't want to -- it's
sometimes just easier for us to talk about it that way.

\* *there are those that want you to pretend its easy when they're being taught, but I find this to be a rare breed, and they probably just learn on their own anyway.*
