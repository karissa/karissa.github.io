When Gmail goes down, I realize how fragile the "new fabric" of our economy really is. We've replaced a lot of our traditional organizational services in the office with internet services. Gmail+google docs+calendar has become my mailbox, filing cabinet, post-it note, notebook, cork board, and voicemail box. My brain was formed in a world where I can assume that I don't need to hold any of this information in my head (or even the location of that information). I only need 'pointers' to that information, rather, ways I can find it with a short set of words. If the Internet (read: abundant electricity) ever leaves us, we will enter a new "dark age" where people don't remember how to organize and process their own information.
