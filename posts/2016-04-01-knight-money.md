I'm happy to announce that my submission to the Knight News Challenge on Data was accepted. My group, Dat, will accept [a $420,000 grant](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201551933/) from the [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/) for a new project that we’re calling “PublicBits.” Our goal is to collect the world’s open data sources, to make their historical data available through a dataset registry at [PublicBits.org](http://publicbits.org/). This “dataset of datasets” will become accessible through a free, decentralized, redundant, open network, inspired by BitTorrent. PublicBits.org will use [Dat](http://dat-data.com/), our flagship project, to craft a new, collaborative framework that breaks down the silos of data portals. Our project takes inspiration from GitHub, the popular platform that allows developers to collaboratively develop software. We plan to bring the collaborative, historical, and reusable nature of open source to the open data movement. The Dat development team will continue to be led by creator Max Ogden, while I will take the reins at PublicBits. 

I'm really excited by this new challenge and am flattered by all of the help I have received in working towards this grant. I want to especially thank Waldo Jacquith for helping with the entire process, with 11th-hour copy editing and constant advice and encouragement. This is my first successfully awarded grant and, I hope, not my last.
