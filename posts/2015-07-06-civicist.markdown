*When it comes to making conned students aware of their right to seek debt discharges, and providing the means for them to apply for that discharge, the Department of Education’s technology is essentially nonexistent.*

I wrote an article in civicist for the Debt Collective.

[Volunteer Coders Force the Dept Of Education to Actually Help Debtors](http://civichall.org/civicist/what-the-dept-of-education-should-have-done-years-ago/)

>  One of the only existing safety nets for millions of student debtors is the Higher Education Act, which gives the Department of Education authority to cancel debt when a school violates state law. But for many years the Department’s website had little to no information on how to dispute debt, let alone an online application to do so. The process was an uphill, seemingly impossible battle for debtors. That is, it was until this year, when a small group of volunteers at the Debt Collective decided to do something radical: the government’s job.
