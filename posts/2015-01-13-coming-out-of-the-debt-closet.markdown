I've come out of the closet before, and I'm going to do it again. I paid my student loan payment today. (20 years ago that would be 'I kissed a girl today' ;p)

I'm 24 years old and my debt is $75,817.81. The interest rates on my 6 loans vary between 4.5% and 11%. My total minimum payments hover somewhere around $400 or $500 a month.

## Calculator
Here's what happened when I put in my worst loan into an online
debt calculator. For just one of my Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) loans, the
principal balance is $33,000 (I think this was my freshman year -- room+board+tuition). If I just pay the minimum payment, which is about
$159/month, I won't be debt free, ever.

Keep in mind that this is just about half of the total
that I owe, so the prospects are surely worse for the full amount. The reality
is that most people don't make as much money as I do. Most people can only pay
the minimum payment, or can't pay at all. [13.7 percent of student debtors are
in default (haven't paid a single payment in 3
years)](http://www.ticas.org/files/pub//CDR_2014_NR.pdf) and it is rising.
There's no way to erase student loans (via bankruptcy, for example), because
effectively you've agreed to mortgage your mind. And those who can't pay will
have their wages garnished if they can't get on income based repayment in time.

I'm one of the few "lucky ones" who will be able to pay off this monstrosity.

Thankfully, I have a (currently) lucrative skillset in computer programming,
making me fortunate enough to make about $2k a month after taxes, healthcare,
food, and rent.  I'm able to pay more than the minimum monthly payments -- and
if I continue doing that, I'll be debt free before I'm 40.

Paying off my debt means I'd have to continue making as much money as I do for
the next 15 years. But if it was a perfect world, I'd like to take a pay cut at
some point to do something different. Teaching, music, research, community organizing, and pro-bono tech
work -- all of these services make our society a nicer place and make me feel better
about my place in it -- but they don't pay very well.  I wouldn't be able to pay off the debt if I majored in something else or
changed careers right now, because they just don't pay well enough.  I'd be
paying on the minimum payment for so long that the interest would rack up.

Most people in my generation are in this situation. They can't even pay the minimum payment, let
alone the double or triple it will require to be truly debt free. It is no
surprise, then, that my generation (millenials) [don't save a
penny](http://money.cnn.com/2014/11/10/pf/millennials-negative-savings/),
[don't own
cars](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/14/the-many-reasons-millennials-are-shunning-cars/),
and [aren't buying homes](http://www.cnbc.com/id/102252789) (all articles written
in the last 3 months of 2014).

If we all just pay the minimum payment, we are trapped in a never-ending debt
spiral.  This brings up a tough question for my generation -- the generation of
student debtors. What does our monetary freedom look like? Will we ever be free
of debt? Or are we simply under indentured servitude to our lenders?

In fact, I think that indentured servitude is **exactly** what the lenders want.

## The loan narrative
The popular narrative of a loan is that you're borrowing
some money that the other person needed, that you are a burden onto them, and
as such it is optimal to pay back the balance as quickly as possible.

But contrary to this narrative, some lenders don't want you to pay off your debt. They'd
rather collect interest on your minimum payment forever.  The corporations that
can afford to have this mentality are very powerful. They have
their [corrupted fingers in our
government](http://www.npr.org/2014/09/26/351520037/former-fed-bank-examiner-says-secret-tapes-show-fed-leniency)
[in too many places to
count](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/07/12/cori-j12.html), and eagerly
take advantage of young eager minds, low-income communities, people of color, disabled folk, and
veterans, all of whom just wanted to get ahead in life.

These corporations are dangerous to the fabric of our
society - to our economy, to our standard of living, and to our health as a community.

## No more debt servitude

Is it debt servitude to offer your money endlessly to a corporation with
interest rates so high that you have no hope of ever paying it back? Or is it
debt servitude to offer the fruits of your labor to do something or to somewhere you hate,
just so your debt will eventually be gone?

I want neither. I don't want to pay it anymore. I'm tired of being scared and alone about the
prospect that I may never pay off my debt. I'm tired of it being always in the
back of my mind, a reason I don't do things I enjoy, or a reason I'm stressed
out about the future.

Even though I don't want to, I'm still paying my debt for now.

People are trying to come up with solutions, though it is tough considering the power of these large banks. Here are some ideas:

  - [a nice sounding but failure-prone debt forgiveness program](http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-america/education/the-problem-with-student-loan-forgiveness-20140421)
  - refinancing, endlessly (not really feasible with large amounts of debt)
  - [cooperative check cashing for when your wages are garnished](https://www.cca.edu/news/2009/common-cents-cca-students-take-predatory-lending-oakland)
  - [debt collectives](http://debtcollective.org)

In all of these solutions, people pool their money and resources together in
some way. It is becoming more clear that
rethinking lending could be a key topic for communities in the 21st century.

Do we really need a loan for a car or
house or education? Are there other ways to provide these services without getting a
large bank involved? I don't have a golden answer, but its something I'm thinking about.
