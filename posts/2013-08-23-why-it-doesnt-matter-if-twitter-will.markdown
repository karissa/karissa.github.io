This past week, we've had a lot of discussion about why Twitter can't predict
an election, and how our
[paper](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2235423) flies in
the face of all that is holy. I'm here to tell you that yes: what everyone else is saying is true. And I'm totally in agreement! 

[In 19 of the past 23 elections, incumbents ended up winning 90% of the time](http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2013/08/17/can-twitter-predict-elections-not-yet/). Yep.
[Your tweets-votes R-squared is too low.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/16/twitter-elections_n_3770125.html). Uh huh.
[Correlation doesn't mean causation](). Yeah?
[The "full" model may be almost as accurate when you exclude the tweet share and just rely on traditional variables](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/16/twitter-elections_n_3770125.html). Of course!
[You really mean contested races. There weren't 406 competitive races](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/14/twitter-predict-elections_n_3755326.html).... Okay sure.

So why don't I care? It's right in front of everyone's eyes. Are you ready? **Twitter can't
predict an election very well by itself, of course.** But name share ("First Last")
remains statistically significant, even with controls. 
<!-- more-->
Not only does it
remain statistically significant, but it [does better than mentions and
hashtags](http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2013/06/26/more-tweets-more-votes-but-why/),
and probably better than follower networks, retweets, and other factors -- but these 
still need to be directly tested.

> People: wait a sec, though. I thought this paper was about predicting elections?

Predicting elections... yeah, the paper uses that methodology. Many pollsters,
computer scientists, political scientists, and other kinds of data scientists
are quite interested in predicting elections -- they want 99.9999999% accuracy.
And the press went crazy for it.  

At the risk of speaking for my colleagues (I'm always willing to take a risk):
predicting elections is not something we are interested in achieving -- and it
isn't even the most interesting and impactful part of the work.

## So what's impactful about it?

The long term impact of this research is building a literature around how
social media can be used as a primary source in the social sciences. So with
this paper, what happens to all of those papers that have used followers,
hashtags, mentions, etc to study politics? Are their samples even
representative or reflective of the general population? No, they are probably not.  

How much of the literature using "Big Data" is actually using accurate human
signals?  How can we capture and filter out the parts of the "Big Data" that
aren't useful in studying humans? 

This is just the beginning.
