How many times have you written an e-mail to a group of people, and someone forgets to reply-all?

Most of the time, we’d like to have everyone respond to everyone else, particularly in collaboration scenarios such as work, school, or side projects. It’s nice when people are least signaling that they have received the message, let alone putting forth valuable insight related to the topic. At the very least, we expect, and hope, that everyone involved will “reply-all” when they respond with something that concerns the entire group.

This doesn’t always happen. Especially with our less “techy” neighbors, it can be easy to accidentally (or unknowingly) not use this seemingly hidden, non-default feature of “replying-all.”

But why is “reply-all” so important? And where does e-mail go particularly bad, even when reply-all is used?

Take this for example (this happened to me once):

> _John_: So, where are we meeting? 376 would really work better for me, I need to drop off my kids at school.
_Becca_: I’m near 376, so that works, but I don’t mind going to Taylor’s office.
_Taylor_: Bob and I will be in my office. Come over.
_Bob_: I don’t really care where we meet.
_Becca_: Maybe it might be better to meet in 376 because of John’s time constraint?
_John_: It’s not a big deal, I don’t mind heading over to your office, Taylor.
_Taylor_: Alright that’s fine, we will head over to 376.

**Where is the group meeting?**

This is what happens with a string of “reply-all”-s at the same time. People are trying to use e-mail like chat. These e-mails enter your e-mail box sequentially, like chat, so I don’t blame people for doing it.

But it’s e-mail, not chat! E-mail is slow. It is modeled after something people like to dub as “snail mail”. There are many buttons to press, and sometimes you might press the wrong one; sometimes people don’t reply-all; sometimes people just genuinely miss your messages; people sometimes write responses at the same time. It wastes time.

Even worse, the loss of communication in a group, particularly in collaboration situations, can lead to the group’s failure to establish goals and execute them. It can lead to misunderstandings, to duplication of work, or absence of it entirely.

The sequential pattern of e-mail sometimes just doesn’t make any sense. People often reply to e-mails that are out of date, perhaps due to lag or a missed message. The easy way to fix this, is, of course, real-life communication simulation. Haven’t we fixed this already, though? With chat?

Maybe we could detect when everyone in your recipients list is online, and immediately put them in a chat room together, instead of forcing everyone to comply with the constraints of e-mail . A dynamic response system could work like chat when possible, and work like snail-mail otherwise.
